## End to End  project to predict student scores in exams

This is a project aimed at developing a prediction tool for student performance in exams based on the dataset sourced from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams.
Krish naik's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m3CPP-93RI&list=WL&index=3)  has been used in developing this project 

Some of the skills learnt through this project is writing modular and scalable code, coding best practices and deployment skills

The code in github will be made use of by a CI(Continous Integration) pipeline  which will be used to deploy a web app where users can provide inputs to see predictions by the model.
AWS Codepipeline and ELasticBeanStalk are some of the tools being used to finish the deployment process which is currently WIP
